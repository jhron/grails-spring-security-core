Grails Spring Security ACL Plugin
==================================

See [documentation](https://apache.github.io/grails-spring-security/latest/acl-plugin/guide) for further information.

## Features

- **Configurable domain classes** -- ACL domain classes use a trait-based
  architecture (`AclClassTrait`, `AclSidTrait`, `AclObjectIdentityTrait`,
  `AclEntryTrait`) that allows you to replace the default implementations with
  custom domain classes. This enables advanced use cases such as GORM
  multi-tenancy and 2nd-level caching. See the
  [Configurable Domain Classes](https://apache.github.io/grails-spring-security/latest/acl-plugin/guide#acl-configurableDomainClasses)
  section in the documentation.

## v5.0.0 changes

### Caching

The default cache manager has changed to
[JCacheCacheManager](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/6.2.0/javadoc-api/org/springframework/cache/jcache/JCacheCacheManager.html).

### Method parameter discovery

The behavior of parameter discovery has changed to align with
[Spring Security 6 default](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/6.4.1/api//org/springframework/security/core/parameters/DefaultSecurityParameterNameDiscoverer.html)
behavior.  This may require code changes if you are utilizing ACL
annotations that reference method parameters.  You will need to add the
[P](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/6.4.1/api/org/springframework/security/core/parameters/P.html)
annotation to reference method parameters.  This is documented in the
Spring Security reference doc under the
[Using Method Parameters](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/authorization/method-security.html#using_method_parameters)
section.

Previously if you had code similar to:
```
@PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#contract, 'write')")
public void updateContact(Contact contact) {
    ...
}
```

This should be changed to:

```
import org.springframework.security.core.parameters.P

@PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#contract, 'write')")
public void updateContact(@P("contract") Contact contact) {
    ...
}
```

Since parameter `contract` is referenced in the `@PreAuthorize` annotation, it
should now be annotated with `@P`.
